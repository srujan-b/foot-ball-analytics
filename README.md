## 🚀 **Overview**  
This project utilizes **YOLOv8** and **Supervision ByteTrack** to analyze football matches, tracking **players, teams, the ball, and camera tilt** while computing **ball possession percentages** per team. Additionally, a **2D tactical map** displays real-time player and ball positions for strategic insights.
